### Hi there, I'm Marco 👋

🕵‍♂ I am a data and investigative journalist.

🌎 I'm Italian, but I've lived and worked in six continents across four continents. I speak five languages!

🌱 Currently learning JavaScript and D3 for data visualization. And then HTML, CSS, Python, SQLite, R, etc. etc.

🎶 Goldie for scraping, Brian Eno for cleaning, Daft Punk for visualization.

⭐ Check out my [project on prison overcrowding in Italy](https://marcodallastella.github.io/schiacciati/) where I built an entire webpage with plots in D3 and a Mapbox map that updates automatically once a month  with the most recent data available, scraped from the not-so-ready to use website of the Ministry of Justice.
